Workshop 5

I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

While doing this workshop, I have learned a lot of new things where I got a chance to exercise template and lambda function. There were a lot of problems that occurred in some modules. Specially, spellCheck part was really difficult for me such as books and movie loading. I read the notes a lot of times and tried to learn form online as well.

Between lambda function and a functor, lambda function is more simpler than a functor cause it doesn’t require an class and user helpful whereas a functor requires a class and more complicated in using rather than lambda function.

There are some errors that can be caused for not using exceptions such as the filename issues. If the user inputs the unexpected filename then it can perform a error. In order to duplicate that logic we can put Movie and Book as child classes under a base class.

Default constructor is necessary cause the program data depends on it. If we don’t use it in our program, then it may give us a number of unexpected errors. So, I think it is necessary to keep it for the essence of the program.
